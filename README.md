Saving Princess Emily

Introduction
'Saving Princess Emily' (SPE) has been designed as a choose your own adventure game with a medieval theme, where players are able to select the direction they want the story to go in with a personalised character name. Throughout the game, players select their character, directions, decisions and attacking strategies as they encounter scenarios with royalty, creatures and crossroads. 

Purpose:
The game was developed as part of an introduction to programming course the developer undertook in 2020, to demonstrate technical sophistication and an understanding of terminal processes.

Language:
Ruby

How to run the project:
This program does not require installation.

Target audience:
SPE was designed for teenagers and children (10 - 18 years old), although all ages are encouraged if they wish to delve into the medieval world and explore their imagination. The target audience was selected as the story line is child-friendly, contains age appropriate vocabulary and is thought that it would be enjoyed the most by this group.

Features 

The pathway system: which will allow players to choose between different encounters.
Personalised characters: that enables players to decide between 2 different characters and give them a name.
Health and damage system: provides an objective for the players to finish the game and avoid losing (death).
The user will find out how to use each feature when the game explains and tells the player what to press or do for each feature.
The player will interact with each feature by entering the player's name or choosing a path and even features such as health and damage.


Status Updates

I changed the health system from its own method and added it into the monstera method either sea monster or trolls method.
I had an issue with the damage system adding up properly instead of saying the amount of damage you would do would just keep adding up the amount of damage you do.
I had an issue with the pathway system; it wouldn't go from one file to the next.
I've just started on the character choice but am having a problem with the characters
I'm halfway through adding the damage system but it's not adding up correctly.
I've just tested my character selection as well as a pathway to choose and both are working.
I've just tested my health and damage system and both are working with no errors.
